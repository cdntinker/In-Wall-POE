Designed to fit inside of Wiremold surface mount boxes.

Inspired by the EAP235-wall wireless access point which has pass-through PoE.  I have a little receiver for my weather station that connects to the network via WiFi & is powered by a USB charger.

Center hole, initially,  exists to make room for the Ethernet cable feeding the EAP235.  Of course, it can also allow for the cables to feed into the wall.

But!

Actual board will fit in ANY North American box.

J1 supplies 5V output at up to 7W and can have a USB-A pigtail connected to feed devices outside the box.
