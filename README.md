Designed to fit inside of Wiremold surface mount boxes.

Inspired by the EAP235-wall wireless access point which has pass-through PoE.  I have a little receiver for my weather station that connects to the network via WiFi & is powered by a USB charger.

Center hole, initially,  exists to make room for the Ethernet cable feeding the EAP235.  Of course, it can also allow for the cables to feed into the wall.

J1 supplies 5V output at up to 7W and can have a USB-A pigtail connected to feed devices outside the box.

The outline on layer User1 is the internals of a typical Wiremold surface box.

> [!NOTE]
> The outline on layer User2 in the board view is a fairly accurate representation of an Ethernet plug in position in the jack.

> The outline on layer User3 is a fairly accurate representation of an Ethernet plug in the back of the EAP235.

> [!TIP]
> Actual board should fit in ANY North American box.

> [!TIP]
> The PoE module in use is available in 3v3, 5v0 and 12v versions.
> So, this board could also be used to supply those voltages.

> [!NOTE]
> See notations in the schematic and refer to the datasheet for information about resistors R1-R3.
